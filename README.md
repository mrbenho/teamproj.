# Team project

## 1\.The purpose of this project is 
+ to understand the concept of queues
+ to design operations associated to queues  
+ to implement the operations to realize ADT concept
## 2\.Problem Description
+ There are many applications using queues such as
        Process queue of operating systems
        Assembly line in a factory
        Communication packages
        Messages passed through devices I/O
+ The items to process may 
        arrive at different time 
        require specific machine to process them
+ Simulated time (Counter) for 
        Entering an item to a particular queue (arrival time)
        Processing the next item (Dequeue)
## 3\.Steps
1. Generate data
2. Organize data
    - Read in a set of items
    - Place them in a right order according to arrival time
3. Assign items to corresponding queues
4. Let the user define the process time for items associated to different types of queues 
5. Produce a report containing
    - How many items were processed for each queue
    - Maximum number of items waiting in a queue at one time
    - Average amount of time spent in a queue for each type of items
## 4\. Result
